# Escape Room Game

This is a Python-based Digital Escape Room game built using `Tkinter`. The game involves solving puzzles in different rooms to escape. Each room has its own unique challenge, and players must use their logic and problem-solving skills to advance to the next room.

## Features:
- **Multiple Rooms**: 5 interactive rooms, each with a different puzzle or challenge to solve.
- **Timer**: Countdown timer that adds pressure as you progress.
- **Score**: Earn points by solving puzzles and completing challenges. The faster you complete the puzzles, the higher your score.
- **Restart Game**: Restart the game after completing it or when the timer runs out.

## How it Works:
1. The player starts in the first room with a challenge or puzzle to solve.
2. Each room has a specific puzzle (e.g., number codes, color sequences, riddles, etc.).
3. After solving the puzzle, the player advances to the next room.
4. The game ends when all rooms are completed, or when the timer reaches zero.
5. The player's score is based on the time remaining and the number of puzzles solved.
